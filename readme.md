## About Email Verbiage Generator

This tool allows for rapid creation of email subject & body verbiage based off of a variety of different user entered email variables. The tool was written in HTML and Javascript and uses Bootstrap 4.1 & font-awesome for stylizing.


## Why This Tool Exists

So my use case is simple. I send out a series of the same email "templates" multiple times per day and then multiple days per week. I pull the "variable" data from a variety of systems of record, and amounts to me jumping around to several screens (sometimes multiple times to the same screens) to grab the pieces of info needed to fill out my email templates manually. To add insult to injury - I am limited from a technology standpoint as it pertains to what I can use to address my problem. I needed a solution that could be run locally (not website/web server dependent) and had no real local dependencies beyond a web browser so decided to see what I could create with vanilla HTML/Javascript.
